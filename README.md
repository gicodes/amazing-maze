# Maze-Runner
- is a 2D game logically similar to the popular 'bounce game'.
- Was built with javascript and HTML. Matter is a key dependency.

## User Interface
- users can expect color variation to define various functions.
- maze-runner source files can load and run on standard web browsers.

## User Experience
- It renders a traditional side-scrolling game experience on a remote environment.
- It can best be enjoyed on desktop computers and other wide-screen video machines.
- The in-game navigation support keyboard controls and can be configured to work with advanced controllers.

### Application Scalability
This app is easily scalable in many ways. Let's think about modifying the current state.

- Styling: to improve the user interface and experience, proper styling is required.
- More UI: added features can make this app more interactive. i.e. buttons, input, etc.
- Responsive: this application can be responsive to different devices and screen sizes.
- Navigation: the in-game control currently use keyboard press. External config can be set.
- Web Deployment: Although it doesn't cost much to host and deploy, this app still runs offline. 

Implementing the features above may cost time and resources, so I decided to let it run offline for the time being. Thank you!
